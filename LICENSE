Machine learning Algorithm for Radiative transfer of Generated Exoplanets 
(MARGE), a code to generate data sets, process data, and train 
neural network models.

This project was completed with the support of the NASA Fellowship Activity, 
grant 80NSSC20K0682, held by Principal Investigator Joseph Harrington in 
support of Michael Himes, the principal developer of HOMER.  Adam D. Cobb,
David C. Wright, and Zacchaeus Scheffer  contributed to some aspects of the 
code, as described in the MARGE documentation.
